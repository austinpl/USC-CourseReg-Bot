# USC Course Registration Bot
Developed a bot to automate USC course registration process using Selenium. Deployed on Amazon EC2 for continuous monitoring.

## Integration with Cloud Computing (AWS EC2)
While the course registration bot is designed to automate the registration process effectively, running it on a local PC can be inefficient and problematic for several reasons:
* Limited Uptime: A local PC cannot reliably run 24/7 without interruptions due to power outages, system updates, or hardware failures.
* Performance Constraints: Local machines may struggle with resource-intensive tasks, leading to slower performance and increased latency during peak registration times.
* Network Instability: Home networks are often less stable and secure than cloud-based networks, leading to potential connectivity issues.
